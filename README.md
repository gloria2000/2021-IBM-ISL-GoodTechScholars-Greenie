# Greenie

A platform that builds a <b>community</b> among people and industries towards the attainment of sustainable development goals. Other than that it would aim to provide a standard to the industries by assigning a <b>greenie value</b>, which would denote the contribution of the industry in protecting the environment.

## Problem Statement
  World is facing adverse affects of climate change caused due to the industrial activities and our reliance on them. People are still unaware or ignorant of the condition and its possible affects in the future. But many of the industries are not taking up the responsibility towards responding to the present condition. It is high time that there should be transparency in the methods adopted by the industry for the manufacture of products to promote informed consumption by the public.
  Individual consumer choices are a small contributor to climate change. That doesn't mean they don't matter. But as individuals, most of us are not aware of the potential we have to bring about the change we need right now.
